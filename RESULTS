RESULTS

1. Constant velocity does more harm than good, hinders accuracy.
2. Maximum time spent at each cell better than average time spent at each cell.
3. Using previous probability distribution actually hinders reconstruction.


GRAPHS TO BE DRAWN

neuron selectivity
neuron firing rates
X trajectory and Y trajectory

1-step reconstruction
2-step reconstruction (no more teleportation)
Effect of velocity constant K

n-fold CV results
testing on trained data vs testing on untrained data.
